You should do more research on Floating Point numbers, from exercise 3.

Exercise 4:
The author received that error because he had not defined the car_pool_capacity variable on line 7, as he does in his final bit of code. Since that variable wasn't defined, but was then referenced, Python had no way to know the value of that variable and crapped out.

Exercise 5:
You should read more about old string formats and new string formats, and figure out the difference.

Exercise 6:
3 - I believe there are six places that strings are called within strings in this exercise. In lines 2, 8, 16, 18, and 23.
4 - This actually seems logical. If you're going to add two strings together, you would presume an addition sign would denote that....

Exercise 8:
2 - I believe that the last line of output, starting at line 7, has both single and double quotes because there is an apostrophe in the string that renders within double quotes. This probably makes for easier readability.

Exercise 10:
2 - I don't fully understand why one would use ''' (triple-single-quote) instead of """ (triple-double-quote). According to Stack Overflow, you would only need to use one over the other if the other is represented in your string.

Exercise 11:
1 - The raw_input returns a string.
2 & 3 - See the ex11-extra.py file.
4 - The slash appears in the output because you're using %r, which shows the raw data. If you you used %s, the slash would not appear.

Exercise 12:
1 & 2 - If you run pydoc raw_input on the command line, it will return documentation on raw_input and what it does. Think of pydoc as "python documentation." This will open the terminal into a Vi like editor, so you can press q to quit.

Exercise 13:
1 - The error will appear when you don't give it enough arguments. If you need four arguments, and you only provide three, then it will say it needs more than three arguments to unpack.
