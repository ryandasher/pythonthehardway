Python Characters:

< -> less-than
> -> greater-than
<= -> less-than-equal
>= -> greater-than-equal

Math operations follow the PEMDAS order, so do parenthesis, exponents, multiplication, division, addition and then subtraction.

% is referred to modulo. So if you have 30 % 9, 9 will go into 30 3 times and have 3 left over, so the answer is 3. Modulo always refers to the remainder. If you have 14 % 30, the answer is 14, because 30 can't go into 14, not even once.
